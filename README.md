# What is Level 9th Creative?
Level 9th Creative is a D&D 5e campaign manager with an emphasis put on customizability. I've found that all the already existing campaign managers aren't as flexible as I'd like when it comes to D&D, a game all about imagination and creativity, and this is my response to that issue. A campaign manager that is as flexible as needed.

# Features
Level 9th Creative is in the Pre-Alpha stage of development, so there isn't really much to see. But here are some features planned for Level 9th Creative.
- Dynamic music playback
- Programmable enemy AI (Manual Override will be included)
- High customizability
	- Custom character sheets
	- Custom rules 
	- Custom creatures with custom stats
	- Custom equipment
	- Custom content will react accordingly with each other (an example would be that the character sheet has an equipment slot for bracers, and you can select a piece of armor to be equipped as a bracer.
- Map manager with tokens, Fog of War, and lighting
- Combat tracker
- Plugin support
- And more...[^1]
